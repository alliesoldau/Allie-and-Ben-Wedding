                    <p>Our ceremony and reception will held at the beautiful <a href="https://junefarms.com/">June Farms</a>.</p>
                    <p>June Farms sits on 120 acres in the New York Hudson 
                        Valley and is home to highland cows, goats, horses, 
                        ducks, chickens, pigs, and an adorable barn 
                        cat named Roger.
                    </p>
                    <p>The ceremony will take place in a wooded forest area, 
                        and the reception will take place between an outdoor 
                        tent and a converted barn bar.
                    </p>
                    <p>Guests will be able to explore the farm and meet 
                        the animals if they so desire!
                    </p>
                    <p>While the celebratory areas will be animal free, 
                        those with allergies should be advised that 
                        the farm animals are close by.
